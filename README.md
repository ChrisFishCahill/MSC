# R style guide
http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html

- CL thinks the use of "=" rather than "<-" is probably better, as this would then be consistent between the `.cpp` and `.R` side of things.  This is certainly splitting hairs.  There used to be a difference between these assignment operators pre R version 3, but now they do the same thing.

- CL proposes we follow this style unless we have a good reason not to, will make it easy to sink up both R + TMB scripts.

# Folders
- Some folders contain examples from the workshop, while the "meeting-notes" folder contains BR's meeting notes.
